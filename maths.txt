saturated vapour pressure:

    SVP = Saturated Water Pressure (hPA)
    T = Temperature (C)

    SVP = 6.1078 * 10^( 7.5T / ( T + 237.3 ) )

density of humid air:

    d = density (kg/m^3)
    P = absolute pressure (Pa)
    p[v] = vapour pressure (Pa)
    M[d] = Molar Mass Dry Air
    M[v] = Molar Mass Water Vapour
    R = Universal Gas Constant
    T = temperature (K)

    d = (P*M[d] + p[v] * (M[v] - M[d])) / (R * T)

mass of humid air:

    m = mass (kg)
    d = density(kg/m^3)
    v = volume (m^3)

    m = dv

humidity ratio:

    By Vapour Pressure:

        x = humidity ratio (water/dryair)
        p[w] = partial water vapour pressure (Pa)
        p[a] = absolute pressure (Pa)

        x = 0.62198 * p[w] / (p[a] - p[w)

      By masses


Pollutants:

Pollutants are typically measured in PPM (Parts per Million).

Carbon Dioxide - C02:
The average CO2 level in the atmosphere is ~400ppm.
When a human breaths in they inhale 0.0005M^3 of air of which 400ppm is CO2. When they exhale, C02 levels
rise to 38,000-48,000ppm in exhaled breathe as oxygen is converted to C02 in the respiratory process.
In 1 hour, a human would breathe .48m^3 of air.
The various level of C02 according to https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/120/12/ehp.1104789.pdf:
5,000PPM is the recommended indoor limit for a building where occupants spends 8 hours a day in.
20,000PPM is when humans would have to breathe noticeably more heavily to account for the increase in C02.
40,000PPM is when respiration would increase dramatically.
100,000PPM would lead to visual/performance impairment and even unconsciousness.
250,000PPM would lead to death.


Carbon Monoxide - CO:
The average level of CO in the atmospere is minimal, roughly .1PPM. It doesn't occur naturally
other than volcanic activity.
In homes, the average level of Carbon Monoxide ranges from 0.5 - 5PPM while the safetly levels are as follows:
0-9PPM Safe
10-24PPM possible health effects with long term exposure.
25PPM max level for a building where people spend 8 hours a day.
50PPM max for any period of time.
100PPM headache after 1-2 hours
400PPM headache nausea and death after 3 hours
1600PPM death within 1 hour

Humans produce a very small amount of CO in exhaled breath, usually about 1-3PPM.
Lots of household appliances produces CO, especially those that have heating/cooking elements. The amount the
applicances varies too much so it would probably be better to just let the user state a rate of production.


Organic Compounds:
Indoors, most Volatile Organic compounds come from new furnishings, wall painting and office equipment such as printers,
personal care products, smoking etc.
There are between 50-300 different VOCs indoors so we would implement them as a collective.
<1PPM will not result in any health effects
1-10ppm may produce some minor health effects and complaints
>10ppm will produce more serious effects.
For VOCs, it is probably best to allow the user to specify the growth levels. For the senarios bit its hard to know
as humans don't produce VOCs so it would probabyl be best to have a fixed rate of growth.
